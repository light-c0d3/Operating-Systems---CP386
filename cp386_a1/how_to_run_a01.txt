$ indicates a command line prompt. Do not copy it when running the following material.

To rename makefile.gmk to makefile, run:

$mv Makefile.a1 Makefile

Place makefile is in the same folder where your all .c files are and to compile via terminal, run the command:

$ make

This will compile your all c programs in same folder for Question 1 and Question 2. 

If you want instead run Question 1, run the command:

$ make runq1

For Question 2,  run the command:

$ make runq2

For testing the message if we pass no argument to Question 2,  run the command: 

$ make runq2-err

For printing the count of system calls for Questions 2, run the command:

$make runq2-strace

To clean out the directory, you can use:

$make clean

Notes: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html has a decent reference on makefiles.
